Android-Typewriter
==================

A typewriter interface to Android devices with the USB accessory capability, utilizes code from Follower's [Android background accessory service](https://github.com/follower/android-background-service-usb-accessory/)
Can be set to receive incoming SMS messages, as well as Gmail messages using the Javamail library.

Android App
===========
The app is mostly the same as Follow's original example, and uses a foreground service that maintains a connection to the accessory, launched by an activity triggered by changes to accessory connected state. The service is set to receive specifc intents, currently generated by seperate SMS and Gmail receivers. An activity maintains the gmail accounts that are set to print messages.

Arduino Sketch
==============
The Arduino sketch is derived from an earlier project that prints SMS texts received by a GSM module through its UART connection, which maps received characters to toggles for a pair of 4051 multiplexers, spoofing keyboard presses on the typewriter.
